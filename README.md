# E07b-Procedural-Generation

This exercise is for MSCH-G220 Game Technology, as an introduction to procedural generation tools within the GODOT systems.

Again, this is very simple and merely a fragment of a game. This particular fragment is related to map/maze generation within a game, and systematically creates a randomized tile map maze.

This exercise is also based on the youtube tutorial for maze-generation within GODOT by KidsCanCode. Link to the guide is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YShYWaGF3Nc

Enjoy!
